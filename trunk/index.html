        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Pynote is a tiny ncurses tool written in python which allows you<br/>
            to create, edit and delete notes and export the data to ascii, xml or palm format.<br/>
            <br/>
            There are not many features yet, so if you want a feature should be implemented,<br/>
            please let me know and send me a mail to 
            <a href="mailto:pynote@kai-kuehne.de">pynote@kai-kuehne.de</a>.
